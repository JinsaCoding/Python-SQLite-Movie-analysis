This is a project that utilizes SQLite and Python in order to print out certain movie analysis from movie data bases in a specific format, the test file that was used is also uploaded. Three different files work together in order to print out this information. Starting at data tier which just grabs one row, whatever rows match the criteria,
and performs an action to a database. They are all used within SQLite queries in order to grab information. This information is foun in ObjectTier. I utilized classes in order to develop movie object. There are also multiple methods for grabbing information with SQLite queries, which make use of the data tier methods. Finally, Main utlizies objectTier 
in order to print out certain information that a user chooses from. It prints a menu to choose from and gives basic information about whatever database the user inputs.
